# RelevantHiddenVariables

========================================

This repository contains the Python codes which allows us to study the relevant hidden variables.

In particular, the following Python codes implement the corresponding functions:

-**spin_operators.py** is used to define spin operators (code from Iacopo, with minor revisions)
-**boltzmann_learning.py** is used for inferring the parameters of a spin model using boltzmann learning (code from Iacopo, with minor revisions)
-**optimal_partitioning.py** is used to calculate the optimal partition using Haimovici and Marsili (2015) and calculates the couplings using Gresele and Marsili (2017)
